
 A Web developer is a kind of programmer who specializes in the development of applications relating to the World Wide Web or distributed network applications, which typically run protocols like HTTP from a Web server to a client browser using associated programming languages like HTML/CSS, C#, Ruby and PHP to name a few. A Web developer is usually concerned with the back end or the programming aspect of creating a website or Web application and is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only deals with the aesthetics of a website or application, although many professionals have both skill sets.

A Web Developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function.

A web developer builds and maintains websites with the client and consumer in mind. That is, the end design must include products and services offered and show how users may access these. For example, a customer may want a form to capture an end user’s e-mail to request additional information, provide a newsletter, or thank a customer for their business.

One type of developer may focus on setting up the back end of a site (back-end developer) while another may focus on the client side to add style and functionality to the website itself (front-end developer).

The work is typically very project-focused and involves collaborating with a team of people who help coordinate the client's needs with the end product. Work may include meeting with clients to discuss their needs and requirements for a website or discuss how to keep their website functioning and up-to-date. Web developers typically construct the layout of a website, creating a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design, and may sometimes write content for the website. After a website is up and running, developers make sure that the site is functional on all web browsers, testing and updating as needed.

 1- What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages. It is the application of engineering principles to software development. In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software systems, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations

  Define your goals and stick to them 1-

There are many objectives that a programming engineer seeks: to work as a software developer in a large technology company, build a team and train, and of course the rewarding financial reward will be among your goals. Regardless of the details of your dream, if you want to reach it you must be committed to the goal of becoming a full-time software engineer.

  practice and follow-up everything that is new 2-

You should devote enough time every day or every week to learn what's new in programming, and certainly you can't become a software developer after 10 hours of training, some people say it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert but now you don't need to 10,000 hours of training to get your first job as a developer but you need to devote some time to learning.

  3-Creating new ways to solve problems

Problem solving is the most important skill for software developers, software development and software engineer work is mainly based on problem solving, without network and system problems you will not need programming engineers. That's why you should always discover problems and research ways to solve them in a scientific way. It doesn't matter which programming language or technology you use, and if you can't solve problems, you won't be good at software development.

  4-Read books and see the research of others

One of the things that helps you develop yourself as a reading programming engineer is continuous research, through research you can find out what the former to try to learn and research and develop it and add your own fingerprint
