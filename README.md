#### This project is a course project, for the AI course as part of my bachelor's degree courses.
* In this project, We developed a simple chatbot that provides career counseling by analyzing usersâ€™ questions and answering these questions as if it were answered by an expert or a consultant. This Chatbot helps users to know enough information about any career path including skills needed, work environment, salary, etc, thus, the user decision about their desired career path can be supported using the chatbot.


* The chatbot works in 3 steps :
1. Reading in the source content
2. Reading data and Pre-processing the raw text: 
3. Generating Response 

* The used technologies:
1. NLTK 
2. scikit learn 


The developed chatbot showed a good result as it responds to the user input correctly. Even though the chatbot didn't give a satisfied answer for 
some questions, it answer other questions in a good answer. It can be improved by add more paths and make it more intelligent by using other intelligent algorithms.
